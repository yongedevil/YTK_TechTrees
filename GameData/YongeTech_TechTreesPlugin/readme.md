1.0 Description:
----------------
By itself this mod doesn’t change the technology tree in Kerbal Space Program.  Instead, it adds support for other mods to do so more easily.
  - Allows PART unlocks to be listed in the TechTree ConfigNode rather than having to edit every Part ConfigNode.
  - Allows PARTUPGRADE unlocks to be listed in the TechTree ConfigNode rather than having to edit every Part ConfigNode.
  - Adds support for using custom textures to create icons for the tech tree.
  - Adds a tree selection window to let the player select a tree for each new game.


=================
2.0 Installation:
-----------------
Copy the contents of GameData into the Kerbal GameData folder.

  2.1 Known Issues:
  -----------------
  This mod tracks parts by their name field.  This means if two parts have the same name, only the first will be edited.  

  2.2  Install Options:
  ---------------------
  If you would like to disable the option to select a tech tree, change the "allowTreeSelection" field in YongeTech_TechTreesPlugin/PluginData/YongeTech_TechTreesExpansion/config.xml from '1' to '0'.  This will keep support for the TechTree ConfigNode additions and custom icon support, but remove the option to select a tech tree.
  



=========================
3.0 Creating a Tech Tree:
-------------------------
The mod adds new support to the TechTree ConfigNode and will create icons for use in a tech tree from custom textures.

  3.1 TechTree ConfigNode:
  ------------------------
  The mod adds support for new fields and a new subnode in the TechTree ConfigNode.  Shown below is a sample TechTree node showing the new fields.

TechTree
{
  title = Sample TechTree
  description = An incomplete TechTree showing the basic setup
  unlockAllStartParts = True

  RDNode
  {
    ...
    
    Unlocks
    {
      part = solidBooster_sm
      part = probeStackAdapter
      part = standardNoseCone
      part = sensorThermometer
      part = basicFin
	  
	  partupgrade = LVT-GasGen-propSys
    }
  }

  ...

}


    3.1.1 TechTree Node Fields:
    title: The name of the tree.  Displayed in the tech tree selection window when starting a new game. (approximately a 45 character limit)

    description: Single paragraph description of the tree for the player.  Displayed in the tech tree selection window when starting a new game. (approximately a 400 character limit)

    unlockAllStartParts: If True the mod will automatically unlock all parts in the starting tech node(s), which are any tech nodes with a cost of 0.  This is only relevant if No Entry Purchase Required on Research is disabled in difficulty settings.

    3.1.2 Unlocks Node:
    The Unlocks Node is a new subnode for the RDNode in TechTree.  The Unlocks node has a list of "part" fields containing the names of all the parts unlocked by the RDNode.  The Unlocks node also supports "partupgrade" fields; part upgrades are not used in the stock game but can be found in Porkjet's Stock Engine Overhaul (http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/files/PartOverhauls.zip).
	
	The mod will read this data and handle editing the TechRequired on all the parts and part upgrades.


  3.2 Custom Icons:
  -----------------
  The mod also adds support for custom icons.  All icons should be placed in a directory named "RDSimpleIcons".  .png, .tga, and .dds formats are supported.  The mod will create a custom icon with the same name as the file, without the extension.

  .../RDSimpleIcons/customIcon_tech.png will become "icon = customIcon_tech"
